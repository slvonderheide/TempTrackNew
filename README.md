## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a full-stack application that allows users to search for and view current and 5-day weather forecasts for cities around the world. Built with a pre-existing front end and a custom-built back end, this app integrates the OpenWeather 5-Day Forecast API to provide real-time weather data. Users can search for any city, view weather details, and revisit previously searched cities using a persistent search history.The back end handles API requests, manages search history in a local JSON file, and serves both API and HTML routes. The application is deployed on Render, offering a seamless experience from search to forecast.
